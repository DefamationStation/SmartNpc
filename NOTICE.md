## MineColonies and Structurize

PlayerNpc's `.blueprint` structure-loading support is inspired by and format-compatible with the Structurize blueprint format used by MineColonies.

MineColonies and Structurize are GPL-licensed projects. PlayerNpc is distributed under GPLv3 in `License.md`.

The PlayerNpc builder does not embed MineColonies' colony, work-order, citizen, farming, fishing, or mining AI systems. The PlayerNpc implementation keeps those AI goals native to this mod. The `.blueprint` reader ports the small Structurize v1 compressed-NBT palette/block-index decoding behavior needed to read scanned structures, and the code comments identify the Structurize reference.
